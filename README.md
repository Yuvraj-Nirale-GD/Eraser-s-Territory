\# Erasers Territory



A top-down 2D asymmetric prototype game built in Unity.



\## Concept

The game is based on a chase-and-control mechanic:

\- \*\*Pencils\*\* move around the map leaving trails.

\- \*\*Erasers\*\* attempt to stop pencils by erasing trails and capturing them.

\- Trails act as both progress and vulnerability.



The core focus is on movement feel, trail systems, and asymmetric gameplay.



\## Current Features

\- Acceleration-based movement using Rigidbody2D

\- LineRenderer-based trail system with distance-based point placement

\- Trail length limitation

\- Basic project structure with clean Git setup



\## Tech Stack

\- Unity (2D, URP)

\- C#

\- New Input System

\- Git \& GitHub for version control



\## Project Status

This project is in \*\*early prototype stage\*\*.

Gameplay systems are being developed incrementally.



\## Planned Features

\- Eraser logic and trail erasing

\- Multiple trail types (default, circuit, trap)

\- Circuit completion rules

\- Stamina system for pencils

\- Simple AI or multiplayer support (later)



\## How to Run

1\. Open the project in Unity Hub

2\. Load `SampleScene`

3\. Press Play



\## Notes

This project is under active development.  

Code structure and systems may change as gameplay is refined.
