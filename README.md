# Erasers Territory

A top-down 2D asymmetric prototype game built in Unity.

## Overview
Eraser’s Territory is a 2D game prototype developed using Unity, focused on territory control and player interaction mechanics.
This project explores gameplay systems such as movement, interaction, and basic combat logic.


## Gameplay Concept
The game is based on a chase-and-control mechanic:
The player navigates through a level and interacts with enemy-controlled areas. The objective is to reclaim territory through player actions and mechanics.

\*\*Pencils\*\* move around the map leaving trails.

\*\*Erasers\*\* attempt to stop pencils by erasing trails and capturing them.

Trails act as both progress and vulnerability.
The core focus is on movement feel, trail systems, and asymmetric gameplay.
